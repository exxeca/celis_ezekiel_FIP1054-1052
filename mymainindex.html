                    <p>"Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort.  Here you will find the time to spend quality time together, and this is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend lots of time together.  We, the LeBlanc Family, started in 1958 to take care of guests, in 1987 we moved to couples only (no kids and no meetings/conferences) as we knew that many couples needed special time together.  In 2008, Canada Select which was rating 5000 accommodation properties in Canada, decided we should join them because we were easily in the top 1%, a 5 Star, and we are glad we made it for you to enjoy as you deserve it.  Now, many times of the year, we offer rates super discounted as we wish to be accessible to as many couples as possible, as all couples should benefit from quiet time together.  We have learned over the decades from our guests that those guests that have a love for gratitude for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, daily I ask how grateful am I, and I hope you are filled with many things that you are grateful for.  If you know other couples who need time away please pass on the word."</p>
